# Bayesian multinomial model with inference based on P ́olya-Gamma augmentation
Statistical inferences from multi-categorical data are often encountered in many scientific fields. It is customary in the literature to model the probability of occurrence of the categories on some risk factors. This work presents a framework to model the stick-breaking probabilities of a multi-categorical event on risk factors. In addition, we adopted a P\'olya-Gamma data augmentation to arrive at a conjugate prior distribution for the model parameters and developed a cheap Gibbs sampling algorithm for model estimation.
The proposed model allows for flexible and computationally efficient modeling of the conditional properties of an ordered categorical process and the incorporation of dependencies between the different categories of the outcome. The framework was used to model data derived from the Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey to study the spatial patterns and risk factors of maternal malnutrition in Nigeria. Findings from the analysis could be relevant for designing intervention programs and guiding policy-making, such as in the allocation of limited resources across the country.
